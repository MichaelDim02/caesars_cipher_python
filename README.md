# CAESAR'S CIPHER IN PYTHON
A Caesar's Cipher implementation in Python including a bruteforcing tool for cracking the cipher.

The code is as minimalistic as it gets and well optimized.

Usage example: python cen.py 10 'This is text to be encrypted'
Make sure you include the apostrophes.
# WARNING!
Caesar's cipher is completely insecure and broken. Do not use it in any scenario in which actual security is required.
The fact that I provide an 100% successful bruteforcing tool (bf.py) used to crack the Caesar's cipher should be indicative of its security, or lack thereof.
You can use it to avoid word detection algorithms, but that's pretty much it.
This is for educational purposes only.
