# caesars_cipher_python
A Caesar's Cipher implementation in Python

The code is as minimalistic as it gets and well optimized.

# WARNING!
Caesar's cipher is completely insecure and broken. Do not use it in any scenario in which actual security is required.
You can use it to avoid word detection algorithms, but that's pretty much it.
This is for educational purposes only.
